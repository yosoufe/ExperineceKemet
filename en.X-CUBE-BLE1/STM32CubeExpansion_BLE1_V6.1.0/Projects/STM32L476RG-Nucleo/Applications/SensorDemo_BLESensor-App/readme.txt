@par Example Description 

This application contains an example which shows how to implement the Sensor Demo 
application tailored for interacting with the "ST BLE Sensor" app for Android/iOS 
devices.
The "ST BLE Sensor" app is freely available on both GooglePlay and iTunes
  - iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/st-bluems/id993670214
  - GooglePlay: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.st.bluems
The source code of the "ST BLE Sensor" app is available on GitHub at:
  - iOS: https://github.com/STMicroelectronics-CentralLabs/STBlueMS_iOS
  - Android: https://github.com/STMicroelectronics-CentralLabs/STBlueMS_Android

NO SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU BY STMICROELECTRONICS FOR ANY OF THE
ANDROID/iOS app INCLUDED IN OR REFERENCED BY THIS PACKAGE.

After establishing the connection between the STM32 board and the smartphone:
•	the temperature and the pressure emulated values are sent by the STM32 board to 
    the mobile device and are shown in the ENVIRONMENTAL tab;
•	the emulated sensor fusion data sent by the STM32 board to the mobile device 
    reflects into the cube rotation showed in the app’s MEMS SENSOR FUSION tab
•	the plot of the emulated data (temperature, pressure, sensor fusion data, 
    accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) sent by the board are shown in the 
	PLOT DATA tab;
•	in the RSSI & Battery tab the RSSI value is shown.
According to the value of the #define USE_BUTTON in file app_bluenrg_ms.c, the 
environmental and the motion data can be sent automatically (with 1 sec period) 
or when the User Button is pressed.

The communication is done using a vendor specific profile.

  
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo boards with X-NUCLEO-IDB05A2 STM32 expansion board
    (the X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 expansion board can be also used)
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    - NUCLEO-L053R8 RevC board
    - NUCLEO-F401RE RevC board
    - NUCLEO-L476RG RevC board
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    This example runs also on the NUCLEO-F411RE RevC board, even if the chip could
    be not exploited at its best since the projects are configured for the
    NUCLEO-F401RE target board.

  
@par How to use it? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.4.1).
   Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V5.31.0) or the IAR toolchain (this firmware has 
   been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V8.50.5).
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
   folder included in the distributed package.
