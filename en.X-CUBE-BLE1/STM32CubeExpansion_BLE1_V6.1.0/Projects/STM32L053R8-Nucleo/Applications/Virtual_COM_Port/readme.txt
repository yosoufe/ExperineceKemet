@par Example Description 

- Virtual_COM_Port is the application to be loaded in order to use the tools for
  updating the BlueNRG-MS firmware on the X-NUCLEO-IDB05A2 expansion board
  (see readme.txt in folder Utilities/PC_Software/FlashUpaterTool).
- User can also use this project in order to port the BlueNRG-MS VCOM application to his
  specific BlueNRG-MS PCB (assuming that the customer PCB has a USB or RS232 I/O port
  available for PC connection).
- This application provides an interface compliant with the Bluetooth Low Energy DTM
  test commands.
- This application is not a reference application to be used for BlueNRG-MS application
  development and evaluation. 
  
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo boards with X-NUCLEO-IDB05A2 STM32 expansion board
    (the X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 expansion board can be also used)
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    - NUCLEO-L053R8 RevC board
    - NUCLEO-F401RE RevC board
    - NUCLEO-L476RG RevC board
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    This example runs also on the NUCLEO-F411RE RevC board, even if the chip could
    be not exploited at its best since the projects are configured for the
    NUCLEO-F401RE target board.
  - This example is currently aligned with the STSW-BLUENRG-DK 2.6.0
    

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.4.1).
   Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V5.31.0) or the IAR toolchain (this firmware has 
   been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V8.50.5).
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
   folder included in the distributed package.

 - IMPORTANT NOTE: To avoid issues with USB connection (mandatory if you have USB 3.0), it is   
   suggested to update the ST-Link/V2 firmware for STM32 Nucleo boards to the latest version.
   Please refer to the readme.txt file in the Applications directory for details.
